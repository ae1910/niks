# NIKS
With so many products on the market, it can be difficult to figure out what skincare products will work for you. Choosing skincare is an overwhelming task and this site would simplify the process by allowing users to see what products work within their routine, as it also includes a quiz that could help products based on your skin type and concern. NIKS offers a clear and concise information about skincare for people that are new or wish to learn more about skincare all in one place. Everybody has different skin types and concerns and deserves access to the information they need to achieve their skin goals.

## Technologies Used
+ PostgreSQL

## Key Features
+ A quiz users can take to get a customized list of skin care products that match their needs
+ Products page to browse products, with the option to filter for users to specify their search

## Problems We Encountered
+ To make sure we had enough products, we had to individually research each product to make sure it conformed to the skin concerns and types that we were targeting. So, researching our database took much longer than we originally anticipated because we had so much information to include.
+ Formatting/ normalizing the data we collected: We had to organize all the data we collected in order to make sure it included all the information we needed when connecting it to the front-end
+ Connecting AWS
+ Creating an accessible database
+ Following our projected timeline
